                          Water Riddle
```
# What is this?

This is an attempt to recreate a riddle from Die Hard With a Vengeance:
```
In the movie Die Hard 3, Bruce Willis is given this task: he has to figure out how to get exactly 4 litres of water in a beaker. He has a tap with running water, a 3 litre beaker and a 5 litre beaker. There is no shortage of water in the tap, but time is limited, so he needs to get to the answer in the minimum number of steps.
```

# How does it work?

This will hopefully be a live web application so the eventual URL will go here, as will instructions on how to interact with it.

# Tech I'm using:

* Node.js
* Jasmine
* Javascript
* HTML and CSS

# My approach:

I was originally hoping to make this very interactive by making a graphical user interface in HMTL5 Canvas, which seems like a good platform for web apps and games, but my experience has shown that it's difficult to test. Although it wouldn't be impossible, I wasn't satisfied that I would be able to have a canvas app properly tested within the time constraints of this test.
